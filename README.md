express-login-example
=====================

Example of simple local login for expressjs

Out of a rant with passportjs I decided to make this example, 
because there is very little info in how to do this and with every 
google search you end up reading about passportjs and everyauth.

So here is a working example you can mess with it


##### the login code is in [app.js](https://github.com/lazychino/express-login-example/blob/master/app.js) everthing else is for the demo

to run the demo just run `npm install` then `npm start`

any issues or need help? hit the issues! 

### :) happy coding
