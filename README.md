express-login-example
=====================

Example of simple local login for expressjs

out of a rant with passportjs I decided to make this example 
because there is very little info in how to do this and with every 
google search you end up reading about passportjs and everyauth

so here is a working example you can mess with it

the login code is in [app.js](https://github.com/lazychino/express-login-example/blob/master/app.js)
everthing else is for the demo

any issues or get hit the issues! :) happy coding
